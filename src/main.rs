/// Lee Algorithm in rust provides one of the shortest paths through a maze.
///
/// Maze may be 2d (Vec<Vec<bool>>) or 3d, 4d or 5d (Yea! 5D - plan your nth morning commute through shifting traffic and 2% driver crazies to arrive at a place and time... probably.)
/// Maze need not be composed of same length vectors.  Movement rules (allowed directions) through maze need to be defined in a vector.  
/// The maze may be exceptionally large, but please remember that the Lee algorithm can be memory hungry.
/// Only one fastest path is returned, even if there are many.  Walls are true, paths are zeros.
/// decode the returned maze direction path with your list of allowed directional maze moves by index value.
/// Mazes & minataurs remind me of that song Woolly Bully, so thanks Sam the Sham for that ear-worm.
